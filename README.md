After entering the date of conception, LMP or due date, it creates a printable calendar (use the portrait/landscape print buttons) and a downloadable ICS (iCal) file that can be imported into google/outlook/apple calendar.

# Story
My fianc√© is pregnant and I was surprised that I couldn't find a tool for making simple printable calendars to visualize the weeks of the pregnancy, nor could I find something to add the weeks to a digital calendar.

Behold, the vibe-coded https://pregnancy-calendar.blackmad.com/

I would love to hear if people find this useful!
